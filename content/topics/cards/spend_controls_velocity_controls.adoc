=== Controls to limit amount and frequency of spending

To limit the amount or frequency of spending, use velocity controls. Velocity controls allow you to set how much users can spend and/or the number of transactions they can make within a given window of time.

The configurable parameters for velocity controls include:

- *Amount limit* – The maximum amount the user can spend in a given window of time (such as $200 per day, $1000 per month).
- *Usage limit* – The maximum number of transactions the user can make in a given window of time (such as three transactions per day, ten transactions per month).
- *Velocity window* – The window of time over which the control applies (such as per day, per week, per month, forever, per transaction).
- *Transaction types* – The type of transactions to which the control applies (such as retail purchases, ATM withdrawals, bank transfers).
- *Merchant scope* – The merchant or group of merchants to which the control applies (such as MID 12345).
