At Marqeta, security is paramount.

- Marqeta's world-class data centers deploy the latest in hardware and software security best practices.
- Communication with all Marqeta platform services requires TLS 1.2 or higher.
- Marqeta maintains PCI-DSS level 1 and SSAE-18 compliance certifications.
- Marqeta employs bank-grade encryption for PII, PCI, and PIN data-in-transit and data-at-rest.
- Funding source payment card numbers (PANs) are not stored on our servers; we only store tokens for these payment instruments.
- Your program has a dedicated production environment that segregates your data from other Marqeta programs.
