The *Address Verification System (AVS)* compares purchaser-provided address data against card holder address data held on file by the Marqeta platform and makes a match determination.
You can configure AVS to decline transactions programmatically based on a mismatched street address or postal code.

AVS is useful for card-not-present environments, such as e-commerce websites, and points of sale without clerks, such as automated fuel dispensersâ€”wherever there is additional need to verify that the person making the purchase is the legitimate card holder.

At the end of the guide, you should understand:

- How AVS makes a match determination.
- The role of AVS in the transaction lifecycle.
- How the Marqeta platform records AVS decisions.
- How AVS affects transactions using Just-in-Time (JIT) Funding.
