== Create card

*Action:* `POST` +
*Endpoint:* `/cards`

Create a card using the user_token of the user that will own the card and the card_product_token of the card product that will control the card. 
You must therefore create the user and card product before you can create the card.

[NOTE]
By default, newly created cards are inactive and must be explicitly activated (see Create Card Transition for information on activating cards). 
Alternatively, you can configure your card product's config.card_life_cycle.activate_upon_issue field such that cards are activated upon issue (see Card Products).

Submit a `POST` to `/pins/controltoken` to set the card PIN if your program requires PIN numbers (for example, for EMV cards); this action updates the `pin_is_set` field to "true" (see the "Create or Update PIN" section on this page for details).

=== Query parameters

You can use optional query parameters to show both PAN and CVV2 number in the response. 
Note that if show_pan and show_cvv_number are set to "true", the fulfillment state of the card is DIGITALLY_PRESENTED instead of the normal initial state of ISSUED; this alternate state does not affect the delivery of physical cards.

=== Card state and fulfillment status

Every card object has state and fulfillment status fields that cannot be set directly using the /cards endpoint. 
A card's state and physical order fulfillment status is managed either by the Marqeta platform or through the /cardtransitions endpoint (see Managing Lost, Stolen, or Damaged Cards). 

==== Card state

|===
| State | Description 

| UNACTIVATED |  The card has been created but is non-functional. This is the initial state of a card.
| ACTIVE | The card is functional. A card can transition to an ACTIVE state only from an UNACTIVATED or SUSPENDED state. <br> <br>  This state can result from card activation (or re-activation from a SUSPENDED state) by Marqeta, Marqeta customer, or the card holder (see <a href="https://www.marqeta.com/api/docs/VhypzxwAANwA_Vgx/cards#create_card_transition"> Create Card Transition</a>).
| SUSPENDED |  The card is temporarily non-functional. Refunds can still be completed while a card is suspended. A card can transition from ACTIVE to SUSPENDED and back to ACTIVE again. <br> <br> This state can result from card suspension by Marqeta, the Marqeta customer, or the card holder.
| TERMINATED | The card is permanently non-functional and cannot transition to any other state. Refunds can still be completed after a card is terminated.<br> <br> This state can result from card termination by Marqeta, the Marqeta customer, or the card holder. Depending on your program settings, this state can also result from activation or re-activation of another card.
