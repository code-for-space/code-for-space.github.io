== Create and send transmissions

*Action:* `POST` +
*Endpoint:* `/transmissions`

A transmission is an email or fax sent to a recipient and includes a single-use virtual payment card with optional message and metadata. The transmission is formatted based on the specified template.

When you create a new transmission, the Marqeta platform automatically sends it to the specified recipient—you do not need to make a separate API call. The Marqeta platform response includes the transmission_outbounds object, which you can use to track the state of each send attempt.
