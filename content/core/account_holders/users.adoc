The users resource represents a person who uses a Marqeta card (physical or virtual) to redeem offers and access Marqeta-administered funds. 
This endpoint enables you to create and manage users on the Marqeta platform.

This resource stores user attributes such as name, address, and date of birth, as well as financial information such as balances. 
By default, every user automatically has a general purpose account (GPA) that is used for the funding of transfers and is therefore an account holder. 
Note that account balances reside at the account holder level â€” there are no separate "account" or "balance" objects.

You can use the `/users` endpoint to create parent-child relationships between two users (where one user is the parent and the other is the child) or between a business and user (where the business is the parent and the user is the child). 
This relationship provides reporting to the parent about how cards of children are used and enables the parent to monitor and even restrict card usage.

[NOTE]
A user can simultaneously be a child of a business and a parent of other users if the user is not configured to use a parent's account balances and the user's child is configured to use a parent's account balances.
