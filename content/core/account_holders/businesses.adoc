The business resource represents a business on the Marqeta platform. 
This resource stores business attributes such as the legal and DBA names, office location, date of establishment, and financial information such as account balances. 
By default, every business automatically has a general purpose account (GPA). 
Businesses are allowed to also have merchant-specific accounts (MSAs). 
Note that account balances reside at the business level â€” there are no separate "account" or "balance" objects.

The Marqeta platform allows you to set up business-user hierarchical relationships that enable a business to control and monitor the card use of some specified group of users. 
In a hierarchical sense, the business is a "parent" and the users are "children". 
Businesses cannot directly own cards, but their children can. In real-life terms, these children would likely be employees, or perhaps customers. 
You declare the parent-child hierarchical relationship between a business and user within the user definition by referencing the token that identifies the business. 
A business cannot be the child of another business or of a user.

[NOTE]
A user can simultaneously be a child of a business and a parent of other users if the user is not configured to use the parent's account balances and the user's children are configured to use the parent's account balances.
