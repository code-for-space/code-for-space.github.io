Use the `/bulkissuances` endpoint to order payment cards in bulk.

The cards in a bulk card order are either all owned by a single specified user, or each is owned by a different, dynamically generated user. 
If you create a bulk card order with separate owners for each card, the cards are shipped directly to the card owners.

You can print personalized information on each card, along with a unique, identifying number that matches a numeric postfix from the token field of the card.

[NOTE]
For more information on cards, see <</guides/cards/about_cards.adoc#_about_cards, About Cards>>.

== Create bulk card order

*Action:* `POST` +
*Endpoint:* `/bulkissuances`

Use this endpoint to order cards in bulk.

[WARNING]
Before creating a bulk card order, ensure that the `config.fulfillment.bulk_ship` field of the associated card product is set to true.

As part of creating a bulk card order, you either associate all cards with the same user or each card with a unique user.

To associate all cards with the same user:

- Set `user_association.single_inventory_user=true`
- Set `user_association.single_inventory_user_token equal to the token of an existing user`.

The bulk card order automatically populates the database with the appropriate card objects. 
Values for the card token fields are generated in the format "card-numericPostfix", where numericPostfix is a number that is incremented by 1 as each card is generated (for example, "card-1", "card-2", "card-3", etc.). 
The numericPostfix for subsequent bulk orders starts where the previous ended, +1.

To associate each card with a unique user, set user_association.single_inventory_user=false. 
In this case, both cards and associated users are automatically generated. 
Values for the user token fields are generated in the format "user-numericPostfix". 
The numericPostfix values for cards and their associated users match. 
This value is also printed on the physical cards if the name_line_1_numeric_postfix field is set to true.

[NOTE]
Placing a bulk order does not immediately create cards or users. 
This action is performed later at an appropriate time. 
After the cards have processed, you can ascertain the range of the numericPostfix by retrieving the bulk order and examining the name_line1_start_index and name_line1_end_index fields. 
These fields delimit the range of numericPostfix values used in your order.
