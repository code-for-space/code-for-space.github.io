The Core API version is indicated in each endpoint resource path. 
For example, https://api.marqeta.com/v3/users indicates the API is at version 3. 
Marqeta increments the version number when it releases a new version containing backwards-incompatible changes. 
Minor updates and bug fixes are occasionally released without incrementing the version number. 
Ensure that your application gracefully handles API revisions by allowing for additional, unspecified resource fields in the response and for variable response sizes.
